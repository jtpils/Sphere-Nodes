Sphere Nodes

A collection of Matlab functions for generating points on the two sphere, specifically equidistributed octahedral nodes, generalized spiral nods, and Caspar-Klug icosahedral nodes under radial projection or equal area projection. For further description see the Matlab files and [1].

Additional functionality including visualization of the nodes is available at https://github.com/gradywright/spherepts
